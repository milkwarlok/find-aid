# Find Aid Android App.

## Description

"Find Aid" app is designed as a part of the thesis work for Moldova State University.
This app will _not_ be fully functional, but will represent a _proof of concept_.
The _main problem_ that this app is intended to solve is to lessen number of people who die as a consequence of **lack of first aid** in the streets.
The way the app works:
  1. A person sees a person that needs help.
  2. The person open the app, and makes a request in the app "Need help; Unconscious person here".
  3. All people that have the app in the radius of Â±500m are notified that there is a request that a person needs help.
  4. If someone feels confident enough, he/she will come to help that person.
  5. This way there will be a higher chance to connect an ill person and a doctor.
